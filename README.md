# Java Program for Practicing Data Structures & Algorithms
This program is designed for practicing the implementation of Data Structures and Algorithms using the Java programming language. It serves as a hands-on approach to understanding and applying key concepts such as Abstract Data Types (ADT), Sorting Algorithms, and Searching Algorithms.

<br/>

### Prerequisites
To run this program, ensure you have:

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed (version 8 or above).

- An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or NetBeans (preferred).

- Basic understanding of Java syntax and concepts.

## How to Run the Program
### 1. Clone or Download the Repository

At bash
```
git clone https://github.com/hoeleong20/ProgrammeADT.git
```
Alternatively, download the ZIP file from the repository and extract it.

### 2. Open the Project in Your IDE
Open your IDE and import the project folder.
Ensure all dependencies and settings are configured correctly.

### 3. Locate the Control File
Navigate to the ProgrammeControl.java file. This is the entry point of the program and is responsible for orchestrating the execution of different algorithms and data structure implementations.

### 4. Run the Program
Right-Click on the ProgrammeControl.java file.
Select Run Java or Run File (specific wording may vary based on your IDE).

### 5. View Output
Observe the console for the programâ€™s output. Depending on the implementation, you may be prompted for input or see predefined results demonstrating the algorithms.
